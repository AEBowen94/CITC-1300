    <h2>The Sims 3</h2>
    <hr>
<p>The Sims 3 was released on June 2nd, 2009, for PC. It was released on consoles in October of 2010. According to my research as of 2015, it had sold over seven million copies which made it one of the best-selling games of all time. It was the first Sims game to have an open-world concept, as well. Meaning you no longer had to stay in a single lot, you could freely explore the entire town and your Sims are able to move about without triggering a loading screen! Not only that, but the customization has expanded greatly! You could use the “Create a Style” tool which allowed you to change the patterns and colors of objects and clothing. The build mode was also expanded! </p>
<p>How many expansion packs did The Sims 3 have? Eleven! They even had nine “Stuff Packs”. Some of my favorite expansion packs were “Seasons”, “University Life”, and of course “Pets”. They added so many different animals. Not only could you have cats and dogs as pets, but you could also own horses, reptiles, rodents, and birds too! You can adopt them from the shelter and take in strays. An aspect I absolutely loved was the fact you could have full control over the pet as well, just like your Sim. Pets can learn skills and have their own lifetime rewards and wishes, even family trees. You can even ride a horse, which also acts as transportation for a Sim!</p>
<p> Though The Sims 3 has lots of similarities to The Sims 2, there were still some features that got a little better. Pregnancy is one example of this. Your Sims can now announce to their friends and families that they are expecting! A Sim can read a book on pregnancy or even get medical advice from the hospital, some Sims in the medical field can even predict the gender of the baby. If the Sim is in labor, she can have someone drive her to the hospital to deliver the baby, where a blue or pink blanket will cover your baby, revealing if you had a boy or a girl. A little fun fact, listening to the kid’s music or watching the kid’s channel on the tv, you can increase the chances of having twins or triplets! If you have triplets, the mother will be carrying them in a basket until she arrives at home.</p>
