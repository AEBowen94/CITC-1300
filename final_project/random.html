    <h2>The Sims 4</h2>

    <h3></h3>
<p>The Sims 4 was released on September 2nd, 2014, for PC. In November of 2017 they released The Sims 4 to Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Console players will be happy to know that this was the first time that the content pack and full base game became available to them. But if you did not feel like dropping some of your own “Simoleons” for the game, you just had to wait until 2022, to be able to download and play the base game completely free. They even added a gallery where you could share your creations from pets, households, to buildings with other players! You can also download another player’s family or house that they designed themselves. </p>

<p>Customization just got so much better! You can customize everything from body shapes to skin details, like freckles. Ever hated how your Sims used to walk? You can now decide which walk represents them the best. This game was practically made for CC, custom content. Every age, every gender, you could make your own hairstyle, eye color, facial structures, outfits, etc.! If you don’t feel like using the presets of the game or making your own custom content, you can still find plenty on the internet or in the gallery to use. A website I’ve used numerous times is “The Sims Resource”, where you can find everything, from the nails on your Sims, accessories and Sims made from scratch. You can combine different CC from one person’s creation to another, making your own in the process. </p>

<p>So many pros this game has to offer, but it did miss the mark on several occasions for some must haves. Let’s start with infants, something that has been around in every Sims game and they decided not to give us the infant stage of life. It wasn’t until March of 2023 when they finally brought infants into the game! Which is wonderful, but it still wasn’t great, they were practically just an object that took up a slot in your household. Another thing they did not give us right away was pools, which again have always been a thing in The Sims. It took seven patches before we got to have pools in our lots. Speaking of swimming, you can no longer swim in the oceans like in The Sims 3. While they did give us so many improvements and new features, they let us down with things that The Sim community should have never had to complain about. It really did feel like this game, as fun and great as it is, was all about how they could get the most “Simoleons” out of us players. A lot of the “Stuff Packs”, and “Kits” were not even worth the money, again a bunch of things that should have automatically been offered in the base game were now being sold to us.</p>
