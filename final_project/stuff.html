<p>The Sims 2 was released on September 14th, 2004, for PC. Know that 3D aspect we talked about for The Sims on console? They brought it into The Sims 2! Not only was the camera upgraded, but you can also now experience all life stages (baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult, adult, and elder) and unlike the original game, Sim genetics can be passed on to children. Another fun aspect they added was the fact your Sims could now have more of a personality, by having fears, wants, and aspirations. If you ever wished you could capture the life you’ve created on The Sims, guess what? You can! They added a movie maker/game recorder, so you could make your own movie.</p>
<p>Besides giving us many new features and things to accomplish in The Sims 2, they gave us households with elaborate storylines! So, if you’re not sure you want to create a family from scratch, you can join a preset one. Some examples of this are the city of Veronaville, when you click on the city it says “Welcome to Veronaville! Two houses, alike in dignity…The Capps, and Montys have been feuding for years, but that hasn’t stopped the younger generation from crossing boundaries and falling in love. Will their actions lead to ruin, or bring the two families together?” They give you a good idea that there is quite the drama stirring from these families, where some Sims do not like one another which will lead to fights and broken relationships. But it’s up to you to help write the story and help it evolve.</p>
<p>Memories! A simple but amazing feature they added to the game. It’s a form of storytelling about the Sims’ lives. Just like in real life, they can have negative and positive memories which will affect their moods and future outcomes. It gives the game more depth and playability, I feel. An example of this is “child taken by social worker” it’s a negative mood caused when a baby, toddler, or child is left unattended or starved. If a Sim ends up getting the memory of the child being taken away, it will prevent them from adopting children. They even have silly positive ones, like “Ate Grilled Cheese”. </p>
