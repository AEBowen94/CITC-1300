    <h2>The Sims 1</h2>
<p>The Sims was first released on February 4th, 2000, on PC. Who developed this? Maxis. But who published it? EA (Electronic Arts). From 2000 to 2003 they released seven expansion packs for the base game. My all time favorite one happened to be released on September 25th, 2002, which was called “Unleashed”. Any idea what that could involve? Animals! They gave us the ability to own reptiles, cats, dogs, fish, and birds! But not only could we have pets, they added new features like farming and five new careers to choose from.</p>

<p> 2003 EA gave us The Sims for PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. Did you know that it was the first Console Sims game? Also, it was the first game in the series to introduce environment and a fully three-dimensional camera. They had three modes, “Get A Life”, “Play The Sims”, and two player game modes. Let’s talk about “Get A Life”, it’s a gameplay mode where you must complete objectives to progress through the storyline and unlock new areas. “Play The Sims” is literally the free play mode (like the one you’d play for PC) for consoles. The two player game mode is just several different mini games.</p>

<p>We got introduced to Plumbob in the first Sims game. Which is a green crystal that highlights what Sim you are currently on, and it indicates the mood that the Sim is experiencing. If it’s green, you’re in the clear because your Sim is in a good mood. As the mood is getting worse, the green will get paler becoming a neutral color. The redder the plumbob is, the worse the mood is which could mean big trouble for your Sim if you’re not careful! But if they are on a date, they will have a blue one and the deeper shade of blue means a better mood.</p>
