    <h2>Welcome to Resident Evil</h2>

    <h3>My top two RE games:</h3>
    <p>Resident Evil has to be one of my all time favorite franchises that is out there. I grew up playing all of the originals and I have played every single one that has been put out to date. The best Resident Evil game has to be four, hands down. The story and gameplay were perfection. You play as Leon S. Kennedy who is on a mission to rescue the President's daughter, Ashley (who will annoy you for being in the way most of the time). There are fourteen bosses in RE4, all with their own challenges but Jack Krauser is the hardest one you will face. Let's not forget to mention Resident Evil 5 being a top contender especially if you have a friend or someone to play with, it is the first co-op Resident Evil game. You get to play as Chris Redfield or Sheva Alomar throughout the sixteen chapters that are in the game. You'll see why Chris is an icon for Resident Evil and a beast, just like Leon (who I named my son after.) But if you go through all the games, you will see that Chris goes through the most changes when it comes to his physical appearance, seems like Capcom can't quite figure out how they want him to look in each game. Regardless of that, each game is definitely worth a playthrough (maybe not six), but, each story is captivating in their own ways. Plus if you like intense gameplay with horror throughout, you might just be a fan of the franchise.</p>
