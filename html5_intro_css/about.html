    <h2>Fun facts about Resident Evil & Images</h2>
    <p>Resident Evil first released as a game in 1996 for the Playstation. Now there is technically around thirty games for the franchise, but I will say there is about ten to fifteen that are considered canon. They continue to make new games for the franchise, even making remastered verisons of the older ones and remakes. Not only is Resident Evil a game, it is also now in the form of movies, board games, books, comics, and manga. There are six live action movies(most will say they are terrible but, I have a soft spot for them since my mother and I use to always watch them. Yes, they are cheesy and would of been better left as it's own thing, instead of trying to incorporate so many different aspects of the games to the movies.) In my opinion, the animated movies (there is seven of them) are far better than the live action ones. For the novels there are seven that were done by S.D. Perry, five novelisations of the games and two original stories. If you can't tell, I think it's pretty that if you didn't want to necessarily play the games, you can still learn about the lore and the characters through the books or movies, there is plenty of options for anyone wanting to know more about the Resident Evil community. If you're a hardcore fan of the franchise, you know that the show is not even worth mentioning!</p>
