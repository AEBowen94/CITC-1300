    <h2>The Resident Evil Movies</h2>

      <p>I have shared a bit about video games but lets dive into the movies and when they decided to add some of the actual game aspects into the films. There are six movies with the first one coming out in 2002 and the last one coming out in 2016. The first installment was loosely based on video games, so where do we see something in the film from the video game? That happens to be the second installment, Resident Evil Apocalypse, where we meet Jill Valentine and Nemesis. They made the Nemesis look so rad, not exactly like how he looks in the games but close! The other characters they introduced were Wesker, Ada, Leon, Chris, and Claire. Some of the B.O.W.S (Bio Organic Weapon) they added were the Cerberus (Doberman), Executioner or Axeman, Kipepeo, Licker, etc! I think the Cerberus, Lickers, and Nemesis were my favorite B.O.W.s!</p>
<p>Does this make the movies better or worse? I personally think when they started adding too many new things, especially in Resident Evil Retribution and The Final Chapter it became super cheesy. Yes, it’s a cool element to add but I think the way they went about it, just was not it. It seemed as if they were like “these are the last couple movies, we really need to just throw in a bunch of game enemies so people would think it’s more like the video games.” It just did not flow naturally, I think they should have just continued to add some characters & game elements throughout the films, and not having a heavy amount in a couple of the movies. Overall, I still enjoyed the movies even if they were a bit goofy.</p>
