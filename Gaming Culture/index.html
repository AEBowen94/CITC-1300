<h2>Advancements with game technology</h2>
<p>  With technology improving every year, the game industry is only benefiting from this. Games are getting more immersive and graphics getting visually more beautiful with every new game that comes out. Stories evovling and growing in depth to fully hook their player into the world they've created. I cannot forget to mention that games are now able to include a wider audience, allowing friends who play Xbox, Playstation, and PC to all play together without having to have the same console. Also, a pro and a con is most games are more accessible to get online, no more needing to go to the actual store or wait in line at midnight to get your physical copy of the game. </p>

<h2>Streaming video games</h2>
<p>  If anyone grew up from the early 2000's to way earlier you know it was taboo for video games to be labeled as "cool" or something you could make a career out of. I'm aware a lot of people still played them, even had competitions for it; with Esports beginning in 1972. But jump forward to 2011, a streaming service called "Twitch" popped into exsistence and watching people play video games became a huge hit! From games like League of Legends, World of Warcraft, The Sims, to horror and everything else in between, people were streaming themselves playing a video game. It became such a popular and trendy thing for someone to want to partake in, and a huge plus, was the fact you could get paid for doing it. So, not only were men using the site, but more women also joined in. Something that I feel like you didn't hear or see often back in the day happening, with the exception of some of course. Anyways, people used this to their advantage (some with good intentions, some with only fame and attention on the mind), careers could be made from streaming themselves; I'd be lying if I said that wasn't a dream of mine to be able to do one day, but that's beside the point. Not only did streaming take off, but Esports became bigger and better, now anyone can watch the competitions that are being held online with the help of streaming services. You don't even need to go to another state or country to participate as a viewer or competitor. In other words, video games have become easier to obtain, play and more acceptible for anyone to pick up as a hobby. If you have a passion for it, you can even make it a career.</p>
